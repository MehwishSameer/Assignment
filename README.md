# Assignment
This project is a web application that allows users to upload an image containing text (both English and Hindi), extract the text from the image using a vision-language model (Qwen2-VL-2B), and perform keyword search within the extracted text. The application uses Gradio for the interface and can be run locally. 

Refer the README.pdf for a guide through setting up the environment, running the web application, and deploying it.
